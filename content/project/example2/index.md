title: ADAMTSL4 in Idiopathic Pulmonary Hypertension and CTEPH (NCT05478226)
summary: In this work, we conducted proteomic and transcriptomic analysis and identified ADAMTSL4 as a potential marker with good diagnostic value and clinical feature correlation.

Background: Currently, idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension (IPAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are lack of specific biomarker for diagnosis and risk stratification. Multi-omics technology makes it possible to screen for used for clinical practice.

Result: By combining plasma proteomic and tissue transcriptomic data, the current study identified significantly increased ADAMTSL4 expression and good clinical features correlation.

Contribution: By searching public database, GSE15197 dataset was chosen for transcriptomic analysis. ADAMTSL4 expression level was increased in lung tissures in IPAH patients.
