**Background:** Despite of noteworthy advancements in the treatment of patients with PAH, pregnancy is still regarded as contraindication for the substantial risks to both maternal and fetal health. It is of vital to investigate the current diagnostic and treatment status in China and provide a basis for identifying high-risk pregnant women and optimizing clinical practice.

**Current result:** with the collaboration of other colleagues across China, we established a nationwide observational cohort and identified patients at higher risk of adverse outcome. A risk stratification strategy for these group of patients is raised and presents good performance in internal validation. Specifically, it was found that sever WHO heart function, non-congenital heart disease related PAH, early onset of symptom, high Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are all risk factors for adverse clinical events.
