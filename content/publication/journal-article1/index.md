It is observed that males, beer drinkers, Europeans, and Asians in moderate alcohol consumption groups and Europeans in low alcohol consumption groups are at risk of developing AF. More studies are warranted to find those factors that influence alcohol’s effect on predisposing AF.

It is important to identify modifiable risk factors in AF management. Although the association between acute alcohol consumption and the onset of an AF episode has been validated, the effect of chronic alcohol consumption on AF is controversial, especially for those with low to moderate levels of consumption. To comprehensively address this issue, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. The current study included 13 observational studies with 10 266 315 participants. In order to infer whether current pooled analyses are of high confidence to give an absolute answer, graphical augmentations to the funnel plot (extfunnel plot) was used as a robustness testifying method. The main findings are as follows: 1) Low-to-moderate alcohol consumption increased risk of incident AF in males but not in females (Hazard Ratio (HR) is 1.14 (95\%Confidence Interval (CI): 1.07–1.21), HR 1.14 (95\%CI: 1.01–1.28), respectively. 2) Moderate alcohol consumption increased risk in Europeans (HR 1.32 (95\% CI: 1.23–1.42)) and Asians (HR 1.09 (95\%CI: 1.07–1.11)) but not in Americans. 3) Low alcohol consumption increased risk of incident AF in Europeans (HR 1.12, 95\%CI: 1.07–1.17) but not in North Americans. 4) Moderate beer consumption increased risk of incident AF (HR 1.11, 95\%CI: 1.02–1.21).
