    abstract = "{The association between low-to-moderate alcohol consumption and atrial fibrillation (AF) has yet to be fully elucidated. The main purpose of this meta-analysis was to estimate the risk of incident AF related to low-to-moderate alcohol consumption.A meta-analysis was performed on 13 publications discussing the estimated risk for AF with habitual low-to-moderate alcohol intake in 10 266 315 participants. Graphical augmentations to the funnel plots were used to illustrate the potential impact of additional evidence on the current meta-analysis. Thirteen eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. We found that moderate alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of incident AF in males [hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95\\% confidence interval (CI): 1.07–1.11, P \\&lt; 0.00001], Europeans (HR 1.32, 95\\% CI: 1.23–1.42, P \\&lt; 0.00001), and Asians (HR 1.09, 95\\% CI: 1.07–1.11, P \\&lt; 0.00001). Moderate beer consumption was associated with an increased risk of developing AF (HR 1.11, 95\\% CI: 1.02–1.21, P = 0.01). Low alcohol consumption conferred an increased risk of AF in males (HR 1.14, 95\\% CI: 1.01–1.28, P = 0.04) and Europeans (HR 1.12, 95\\% CI: 1.07–1.17, P \\&lt; 0.00001).This analysis represents the increased risk of incident AF in males, Europeans, and Asians at moderate alcohol consumption levels and in males and Europeans at low alcohol consumption levels. Those who drink any preferred alcohol beverage at moderate levels should be cautious for incident AF. More studies are warranted to find those factors that influence alcohol’s effect on predisposing AF.}",
