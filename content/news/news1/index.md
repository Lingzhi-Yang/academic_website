conclusion:  Key genes involving in the pathogenesis of AF were identified. The biological features of CXCL12 in AF were investigated using integrative bioinformatics tools. The results suggested that CXCL12 might be a biomarker that could be used for distinguishing subsets of AF, and indicated that CXCL12 might be an important intermediate in the development of AF by increasing the infiltration of mast cells, neutrophils, and γδ T cells, and reducing infiltration of regulatory T cells. A reliable Machine Learning-based diagnostic model was constructed. Our work improved understanding of the mechanisms of AF predisposition and progression, and identified potential therapeutic avenues for treatment of AF.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of AF and atrial substrate remodeling is necessary for development of novel therapeutic approaches and new management strategies.
